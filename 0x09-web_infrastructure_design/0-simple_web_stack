The pictorial reference to this writing is in the above link.

DNS:
The main role of the DNS is to translate the record of a domain name(www.foobar.com) into an IP address (8.8.8.8).
The website ‘www.foobar.com’ is an A record because it resolves to an IP address(IPV4), 8.8.8.8.

SERVER:
A server is generally located in a data center which is a specially designed structure to hold thousands of machines.
It can be physical or virtual.
The server also runs a special kind of operating system that helps it to perform its services to the end users.
The server here uses the TCP/IP protocol to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website.

WEB SERVER: In this context, an NGINX web server is installed and its primary purpose is to serve hard-coded content, that is, web pages with static content.

APPLICATION SERVER: An application server’s main purpose is to process web server’s requests and serve dynamic web contents.

DATABASE: The database is where information is stored and can be retrieved when the web server sends a request to the application server.

PROBLEMS WITH THIS INFRASTRUCTURE:
SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE(SPOF): the server is a Single Point of Failure because the infrastructure design has no backup server if the present server ever fails. The application would crash if there is any malfunctioning of the server.
MAINTENANCE DOWNTIME: In a situation where a new code is deployed and the server needs to be rebooted, this would cause a downtime as the only server would be unavailable for that period to carry out its functionalities to the clients.
This infrastructure is unscalable because it has one server, no load balancer to handle multiple requests to it.
