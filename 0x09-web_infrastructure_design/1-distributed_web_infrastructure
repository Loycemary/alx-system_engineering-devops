The pictorial reference to this writing is in the above link.

Continuation from task 0:

An extra web server: An extra web server is added to the previous infrastructure so that there is redundancy with the added server.

Load Balancer: This is added to distribute the traffic between the two servers

Load balancer configuration: This load balancer is configured to have an active-active setup to both servers so as to offer more capacity.

Database Primary-Replica: The MySQL Master-Replica cluster used replication to keep data synchronized. This master-slave replication system prevents any downtime as the slave (which is a constant live backup of the database) can always be promoted to master if the original master server crashes.

PROBLEMS WITH THIS INFRASTRUCTURE:

SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE(SPOF): The load balancer is still a single point of failure because if it crashes, the application also crashes.
LACK OF SECURITY: There are no firewalls on the servers which could allow easy entrance of threats. The traffic is also unencrypted.
NO MONITORING
